# cbhistosom
A cyclic-topology batch-update SOM-like ANN algorithm that uses histograms to learn the statistics of its input.

This ANN algorithm was developed for my [PHD dissertation](http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2015/7645/pdf/Dissertation.pdf) "One Computer Scientist's (Deep) Superior Colliculus."

It was used to implement adaptive binaural sound-source localization on a robot.
